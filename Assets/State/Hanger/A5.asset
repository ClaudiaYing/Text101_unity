  stroyText: 'A5. Lock Smashing

    Got to be something around here to help with some smashy smashy. You see a crate
    with all manner of pipes, wires and cogs scattered within it. Mostly trash.


    You could try the brute force approach - wack the lock with one of the pipes.
    Or you could take some time to build a contraption with some kind of leverage,
    maybe a mini pulley system with those wires and the cogs.


    How to proceed?

    1. No time to waste, grab the pipe, start wacking.

    2. Take the time to build a leverage-gadget.'
